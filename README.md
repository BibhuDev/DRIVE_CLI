DriveCLI is a backend-focused project built using the MERN stack, designed as a Google Drive–style cloud storage system with a unique twist — it’s entirely command-line driven, built for programmers who prefer working from the terminal. Instead of a traditional web interface, users interact with the system through a CLI tool that supports familiar shell-like commands such as cd, mkdir, ls, upload, download, and share, providing a seamless “cloud file system” experience. The backend handles authentication (JWT), role-based access control, file storage and versioning (via AWS S3 or MinIO), and hierarchical folder structures stored in MongoDB. Additional features include link-based sharing with expiration, activity tracking, trash and restore functionality, and background jobs powered by Redis and BullMQ. The CLI manages user sessions, displays interactive feedback, and communicates with the backend through secure REST APIs. Designed to teach and demonstrate core and advanced backend concepts — including API design, file streaming, caching, async processing, and secure token handling — DriveCLI represents a complete, developer-centric take on modern cloud storage systems, emphasizing backend architecture over flashy UI.
